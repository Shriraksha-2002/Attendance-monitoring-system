# Attendance-monitoring-system
The IoT-based attendance monitoring system utilizing RFID technology and the ThingSpeak cloud platform.

Introduction
Software called the Attendance Monitoring System was created to track daily attendance
in schools, universities, institutes, and businesses. It makes it easier to get a specific
user’s attendance data every day. The operators, who will be supplied by the owner, sift
the information. This approach aids in assessing attendance eligibility standards. The
intention behind creating an attendance monitoring system is to automate the manual
process of taking attendance. The software’s ability to automatically generate reports at
the session’s end or in between sessions is another reason for its development.

Objectives
• The purpose of the attendance monitoring software is to reduce the time that is
consumed when attendance is taken manually.
• Weekly and monthly attendance reports for the employee are produced.
• When we scan RFID tag count of visitors and their name will be displayed on LCD.
• At the same time, entry date,time and other details will be recorded in ThingSpeak
cloud and tweet will be sent.

EM18 reader module and RFID tags
Radio waves are used by Radio frequency Identification (RFID), a wireless identification
technique, to detect the presence of RFID tags. RFID technology is used to identify the
presence of persons, objects, etc., just like a bar code reader. With bar code technology,
we must hold the bar code in front of the reader to optically scan it, however with RFID
technology, we only need to bring the RFID tags within reading distance. Bar codes can
also become distorted or illegible, which rarely happens with most RFID. RFID is utilised
in many different applications, such as an attendance system that provides each person
with a unique RFID tag to aid in identifying them and their attendance. Many businesses
utilise RFID to grant access to their authorised staff.
